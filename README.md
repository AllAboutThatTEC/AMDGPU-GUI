# AMDGPU-GUI
(hopefully, it wont be done for a while) a GUI for the AMDGPU driver for Linux based OS's for monitoring temperature, usage, etc, 
as well as easily changing config files.


I used the term "hopefully" because I'm busy with school and I'm lazy.
If there is an existing program that does this please let me know, as I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
If there will be any legal issues with AMD if i create this program, please let me know.
Speak now or forever hold your peace. The program will be free, open-source and written very badly in python.
The first step for me at least is to create a basic Python script that will fetch all of the variables on things like temperature,
ram usage and clock speed, etc. and print them nicely into a terminal in an easy to read manner.
Then create another script that will change the config files accordingly based on input from a third script that handles the actual
user interface. Here is the link to the repo: https://github.com/AllAboutThatTEC/AMDGPU-GUI
